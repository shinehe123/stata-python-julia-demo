# ABM Network Simulation

This folder contains a Python script for running a simple agent-based model (ABM) on network structures. Originally it was saved with a `.ipynb` extension but only contained plain Python code, so it has been renamed to `culture_gene_network_abm.py`.

## Requirements

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the script directly with Python:

```bash
python culture_gene_network_abm.py
```

The script will generate simulation results and a CSV output file.
